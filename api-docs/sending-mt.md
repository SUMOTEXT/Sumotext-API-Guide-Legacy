Sending a Mobile Terminated (MT) Message
========

>Send an SMS to a mobile number.

In order to use the SUMOTEXT API to send an MT, your serverâ€˜s IP Address must be registered in the SUMOTEXT API Database and tied to a specific account and dedicated short code.
All clients can send messages from inside our online campaign management tools.
However, if you have a dedicated short code, you are free to send messages from your own internal system via this API.

When you want to send an MT text message from your own system, SUMOTEXT will provide a dedicated HTTPS URL. Use HTTP GET with 5 query string parameters. Parameter names are case sensitive and all lower case.

### HTTP Method - `GET`

### Example URL
```
https://mosms.sumotext.com/secure/sumoSend.aspx?mobile=5015551234&carrier=ATTUS&shortcode=74700&key=SUMO&msg=hello
